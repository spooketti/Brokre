i've been getting into player poker for fun (no money gambled)
i thought it'd be fun to try to code as much of it within a day 
kinda like a game jam

the main challenge is learning the nuanced stuff of the discord.py framework combined with time
but i ngl am imposing the time limit because superposition development would not appreciate me slacking for this
